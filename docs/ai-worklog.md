# AI worklog (for interview transparency)

## Tools used
- AI coding assistant for architecture, scaffolding, endpoint and UI implementation.

## High-level workflow
1. Generated decision-complete implementation plan from product brief.
2. Built backend domain model and API contracts first.
3. Implemented privacy-safe views and transaction logic.
4. Added realtime events and WebSocket channel.
5. Added frontend pages and forms around API contracts.
6. Added URL preview service and dashboard autofill UX.
7. Added tests, Docker, and CI scaffolding.

## Where AI accelerated delivery
- Boilerplate setup for monorepo and stack integration.
- Consistent schema/contract generation and repetitive endpoint wiring.
- UI skeleton and reusable components.
- Deployment and CI templates.

## Human review checkpoints
- Product behavior decisions (edge cases, privacy policy).
- API shape sanity checks.
- Transaction flow validation for reserve/contribution race conditions.
- Final UX polish and demo narrative.
